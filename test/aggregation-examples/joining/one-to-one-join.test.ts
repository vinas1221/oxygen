/**
 * You want to generate a report to list all shop purchases for 2020, showing the product's name and category for each order, rather than the product's id.
 * To achieve this, you need to take the customer orders collection and join each order record to the corresponding product record in the products collection.
 * There is a many:1 relationship between both collections, resulting in a 1:1 join when matching an order to a product.
 * The join will use a single field comparison between both sides, based on the product's id.
 *
 * See {@link https://www.practical-mongodb-aggregations.com/examples/joining/one-to-one-join.html}
