/**
 * At a medical establishment, the central IT system holds patient data that you need to surface
 * to different applications (and their users) according to the application's role: Receptionist, Nurse, and Doctor.
 *
 * Consequently, you will provide a read-only view of patient data, but the view will filter out specific sensitive fields depending on the application's role.
 * For example, the Receptionist's application should not be able to access the patient's current weight and medication.
 * However, the Doctor's application needs this information to enable them to perform their job.
