/**
 * You are monitoring various industrial devices (e.g. heaters, fans) contained in the business locations of your clients.
 * You want to understand the typical patterns of when these devices are on and off to help you optimise for sustainability by reducing energy costs and carbon footprint.
 * The source database contains periodic readings for every device, capturing whether each is currently on or off.
 * You need a less verbose view that condenses this data, highlighting each device's timespan in a particular on or off state.
