/**
 * You want to provide a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search | faceted search} capability on your retail website to enable customers to refine their product search by selecting specific characteristics against the product results listed in the web page.
 * It is beneficial to classify the products by different dimensions, where each dimension, or facet, corresponds to a particular field in a product record (e.g. product rating, product price).
 * Each facet should be broken down into sub-ranges so that a customer can select a specific sub-range (4 - 5 stars) for a particular facet (e.g. rating).
 * The aggregation pipeline will analyse the products collection by each facet's field (rating and price) to determine each facet's spread of values.
